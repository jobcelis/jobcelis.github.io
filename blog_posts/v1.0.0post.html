        <h1>v1.0.0</h1>
        <p><em>Posted on December 16th, 2025</em></p>
<p>I’ve had the idea of building a personal website for a while now. I’ve seen so many developers with their own, each with its own unique design, so I decided to build my own from scratch. I wanted a place to post my thoughts on tech, increase my knowledge in front-end development as I work on it, and show it off in my social bios and resume.</p>

<p>The version I initially worked on was going to feature a rounded navigation bar. I couldn’t find any tutorial or forum that showed how to make it, so with help from a simple post on a coding forum and ChatGPT, I created one and decided to make it public so no other developer would face the same problem. You can find it on my <a href="https://github.com/jobcelis/RoundedNavBar-Demo" target="_blank" style="color: #007bff;">Github account.</a></p>

<p>The website design in the repo shows what my site originally looked like, but I shelved it for a while. When I finally returned to work on it, I changed my mind about the UI and decided it should remain for the repo only. So I started from scratch. I wanted the layout to be as simple as possible to make the work less of a hassle. Right now it may seem rather boring, but over time I’ll be adding new improvements as I go along. Hopefully, I’ll land on a final design.</p>

<p>While building it, I mostly vibecoded it because I wanted to get it out as quickly as I could after putting it off for too long. But that doesn’t mean I ignored the code the AI generated and the issues I encountered. When GPT wasn’t generating the code correctly, I made three separate posts on Stack Overflow that helped with my issues. Even with the ongoing AI boom, Stack Overflow is still very much alive. Hopefully I should be able to continue building my site without the use of LLM's anymore.</p>

<p>The site is built using raw HTML and CSS, but it will receive updates later on.</p>

<p>I’m hoping this site will serve as my personal space on the internet to share projects, write about my thoughts in anything about tech, and document my progress as a developer. Over time, I plan to add more blog posts, and other resources that I find useful, making it a place both for me and for others who are interested in coding and building software.</p>
